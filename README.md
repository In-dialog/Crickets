**Interactive sound installations made off 3D printed parts and a lot of arduino nano**

  The digital crickets are programmed to communicate with each other via sound. When a sound triggers one of the modules, a chain effect
  takes space and the sworn starts to communicate with each other. A microphone and a LED are attached to the parabola which acts as a sound reflector. The surrounding sound is processed
  by an Arduino nano enclosed in the case and a buzzer is embedded in the cone, which spiral creases help to diffuse the sound.
<br/>
## Code
The installation it's powered by a  simple code that listens via a microphone  for high pitch sounds and reacts by activating a buzzer.  After flashing the code the tone of the buzzer can be adjusted via serial thru this commands : 
    
      'C' = LoopCounter  'O' = maximum time on  'F' = second till reset
the comands will be stored in the EEPROM
